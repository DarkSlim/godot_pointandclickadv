Basic Point and Click adventure game demo with Godot

I don't intend to make a full game from this, but it could be a good starting point if I (or anyone) wants to.

This demo project will be complete when it features:
- Objects interactions
- NPC dialog systems
- Room changing
- Inventory & objects combinations
